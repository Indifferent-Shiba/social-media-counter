# Social Media Follower Counter with Raspberry Pi

This project works in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi and some RGB LED matrix displays to display up-to-date follower/like/subscriber counts for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Great to hang on the wall in your office, studio or shop front and a fun way to help you grow your brand's following.

The 64x16 display shows a pixel-perfect copy of the top-left region of the display, which is generated by this code.

The setup uses Adafruit's rpi-fb-matrix (<a href="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/raspberry-pi-led-matrix-display.pdf">see here</a>) which in turn uses hzeller's <a href="https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix">rpi-rgb-led-matrix</a> library.

A full tutorial is coming soon in an upcoming edition of <a href="https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org">HackSpace Magazine</a> so watch this space :-)
